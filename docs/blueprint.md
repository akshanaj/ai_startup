- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA), almost imperceptibly different from white, for a subtle, clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale olive green (#A9B899), which provides a touch of organic warmth without clashing or overpowering.
- Body font: 'Literata' serif, with a vintage and literary feel, will set the overall tone.
- Headline font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif will contrast against the 'Literata' body text, creating necessary separation.
- Simple, minimalist icons for formatting options and export functions.
- Clean and well-spaced layout to ensure readability and a professional appearance.
